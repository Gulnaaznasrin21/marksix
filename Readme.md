# This is a Translator which we can say funny.

For making this translator I used js,html and css
basically I used js for making translate the text in js I attach a url which is a url of fun translator called banana talk or its also called as minion speak.
And html for giving the translate button,when user click the translate button a function will be called
for which I used addEventListener and it will go the function and will work accordingly.
